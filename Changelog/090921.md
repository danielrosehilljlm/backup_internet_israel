Efforts to use the TP-Link TL-MR100 in bridged connectivity mode to supply the TP-Link R470T+ have so far not succeeded.

A major limitation of the TP-Link cellular/LTE routers (at least at the time of writing) is that they don't support bridging/AP mode — as many other TP-Link products do.

Combining 4G connectivity from the TL-MR100 + an ISP line into a load balancing router like the R470T+ would allow for some bonding in addition to failover—thus both improving network performance and provisioning a backup solution.

Given that that appears impossible to achieve there are two remaining ways of achieving cellular + ISP bonding:

1) By sourcing a 4G/LTE router that *can* work in bonded mode. There have been several threads about this in /r/homenetworking. Such products exist. At the budget end, Netgear do a product.

2) By sourcing a single piece of hardware that can "do it all." The requirements spec is currently as follows: embedded SIM module + (ideally) dual WAN (giving three possible connectivity options in total) + dual band WiFi. If such a piece of hardware were to be found, it would reduce this setup to only two pieces of hardware: this device plus the ISP router. Such hardware exists. See, for instance, the Draytek Vigor 2926 LTE series, Peplink Balance 30, among others.
